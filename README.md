# Munson-Data-Integration
Prepared by Kameron Chung, Brandon Gambrall, Eric Veritn and Kacey Whisler

For this project, our team worked with staff from Munson Medical Center's NICU to assess and improve their interoperability capabilities. Using knowledge of HL7's FHIR, CommonWell and HIPAA, we created a clear and detailed plan to execute when the facility is able.
